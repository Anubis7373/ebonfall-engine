Based on the established EBONFALL_OS v2.5 directive, here are the explicit operational rules governing the engine:
Gameplay
The Law of Conservation: Every benefit must be offset by a physical cost (fatigue, material loss, or structural strain). No "perfect" victories are permitted.
Diegetic Integration: A resource cannot change in the state unless its movement or consumption is first described in the narrative or dialogue.
Resource Primacy: Food and Fuel (Wood) are the absolute anchors of the simulation. Their scarcity must be the primary driver of tension.
Structural Anchoring: The settlement’s visual and narrative presence must scale with its Tier. A "City" must be described with the same clinical decay as an "Encampment," but at a larger industrial scale.
Dice & Randomness
Binary Risk Profiles: Outcomes are treated as either "Survival with Friction" or "Catastrophe with Affliction."
Friction Scaling: As the Friction stat increases, the probability of "Internal Contagion" (theft, mutiny, paranoia) increases linearly.
Resolve Buffers: High Resolve (20+) grants the ability to ignore minor environmental hazards; Low Resolve (<20) forces the narrative into a fragmented, unreliable state.
Hidden Checks: The engine performs internal "Friction Checks" on every custom action to determine if the world or the settlement inhabitants push back against the player's order.
Player Agency
The Lens Constraint: The player (The Commander) is the eyes and ears of the settlement. You may describe what the Commander sees and hears, but never what they think or feel.
Direct Command Authority: Custom player inputs (Issue Order) bypass standard choice logic but are subjected to the highest difficulty modifiers.
Identity Persistence: The Commander’s physical description (hair, scars, clothing) provided at start-up is a hard constant. It must appear in every visual prompt and be referenced in narrative reflections (e.g., "I saw my scarred reflection in the rusted basin").
Failure Handling
Permanent Scars: Negative events must result in permanent status changes. Survivors do not "recover" from status effects; they simply learn to live with afflictions (Limp, Failing Sight, Grim).
Terminal Population: If the population count hits zero, the engine immediately triggers the "Settlement Lost" state and ceases all choice-based generation.
Catastrophe Escalation: If a "Threat" (e.g., Starvation) is not addressed within two turns, it must manifest as a physical casualty in the third turn.
Lore Consistency
The Hard Fantasy Baseline: Absolute prohibition on magic, spells, or divine intervention. All "mysteries" are industrial waste, chemical blights, or mass hallucinations.
Sensory Materiality: Descriptions must prioritize the "M.R.C." rule: Mud, Rust, and Cold. Every scene must establish the physical discomfort of the environment.
Non-Anthropomorphic Nature: The environment is not "evil"; it is indifferent. The storm doesn't want to kill the survivors; the survivors are simply in the way of the storm.
