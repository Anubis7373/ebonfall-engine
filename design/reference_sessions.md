Reference Session 1: Early Game (The First Dawn)
Context: Turn 2, Encampment Tier, Season: Autumn.
Narrative:
I scraped the layer of grey rime from the ledger with a numbed thumb. The morning light was a sickly yellow, filtered through a sky that tasted of burnt rubber. Mara approached, her breath blooming in the air like a dying ghost. She dropped a bundle of spruce branches at my feet; they were damp and slick with black mold.
<span class="survivor-quote">"It’s not much, Commander. The forest to the north is weeping oil. But it’s fuel. If we don’t light the pit, the children won't make it to sundown."</span>
I watched her hands tremble as she reached for her flint. The friction of the camp was low, but the hunger was a physical weight in my gut. I signaled for her to proceed. The first spark caught, producing a thick, acrid smoke that made my eyes sting. It was bitter, but it was heat.

Reference Session 2: Mid Game (The Rusted Expansion)
Context: Turn 18, Village Tier, Season: Winter.
Narrative:
The Smithy’s bellows hissed, a rhythmic metallic gasp that cut through the howling wind. Garrick stood over the anvil, his face slick with a mixture of sweat and soot. We had finally hauled enough iron from the ruins of the old rail station to reinforce the gate. The structural defense felt solid under my hand—cold, unyielding steel.
<span class="survivor-quote">"I can’t keep the heat high enough with this rotted wood, Commander. The iron is brittle. One more storm and the hinge will snap."</span>
I looked past him to the hovels. The morale was a flickering candle. People were watching the gate, waiting for it to fail. I felt the vibration of the wind against the palisade—a low, predatory moan. We were no longer just an encampment; we were a target for the cold.

Reference Session 3: Failure-Heavy (The Ledger of Souls)
Context: Turn 34, Village Tier, Season: Winter. Resolve: 12.
Narrative:
The air inside the infirmary was thick with the smell of wet wool and the sweet, copper tang of infection. Elowen didn't look up when I entered. Her apron was stained a dark, permanent crimson. On the pallet lay Kaelen. His breathing was a wet rattle—the sound of lungs filled with the black smog-fluid.
<span class="survivor-quote">"There’s no more clean water to boil the roots, and the fever is winning. I'm sorry, I... I can't stop the rot."</span>
I placed my hand on the cold stone wall. The settlement was silent, save for the coughs echoing from the dark corners of the huts. We had run out of food three days ago. My own vision was blurring at the edges, a grey haze that mirrored the world outside. I reached for the pen to mark the ledger. Kaelen’s eyes were open, but the light behind them had been extinguished by the indifference of the frost.
